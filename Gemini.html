                            Proponents of the Flat Earth model believe that all evidence of a spherical Earth—including satellite images, global navigation, and the existence of time zones—is part of a massive, coordinated deception by governments like NASA. According to some versions of the theory, the "ice wall" of Antarctica holds the oceans in, and beyond it lies a vast, unknown territory. They often cite a "celestial dome" over the Earth and use personal, pseudo-scientific experiments to "prove" their claims. The origins of this modern resurgence can be traced back to the 19th century, but it has gained significant traction in the internet age through social media and online communities.

                            Originating on a fringe internet message board in 2017, QAnon centers on a supposed government insider named "Q" who posted cryptic messages, or "Q drops." These posts claimed that a "Deep State" composed of Democratic politicians, Hollywood celebrities, and business leaders was running a global child sex-trafficking ring. They believed that Donald Trump was secretly fighting this cabal and that a future event called "The Storm" would see the mass arrest and execution of these figures. The theory has absorbed other pre-existing conspiracies, like "Pizzagate," and has been linked to real-world acts of violence and political extremism.

                            The "chemtrails" theory posits that the condensation trails (contrails) left by jet engines are not simple ice crystals, but are toxic substances being dispersed for nefarious reasons. These reasons vary from population control and mind control to weather modification and biological warfare. Proponents distinguish "chemtrails" from "contrails" by their persistence in the sky, often noting that some trails linger and spread out into cirrus-like clouds, while others dissipate quickly. The scientific consensus is that all these phenomena are normal contrails, and their appearance is entirely dependent on atmospheric conditions like temperature and humidity.

                            Located deep in the Nevada desert, Area 51 was a highly classified U.S. military installation for decades, its existence only officially acknowledged in 2013. The secrecy fueled decades of speculation, most famously that the base was home to alien technology and even extraterrestrial bodies from the 1947 Roswell UFO incident. Claims by individuals like Bob Lazar, who said he worked on an alien spacecraft at the base, further cemented this myth in popular culture. While the base's true purpose was the testing of advanced aircraft like the U-2 spy plane, the conspiracy theory remains deeply ingrained in the public imagination.

                            This theory claims that the iconic 1969 moon landing, and subsequent missions, were elaborate hoaxes filmed on a soundstage, possibly directed by Stanley Kubrick. Proponents point to supposed inconsistencies in the photos and videos as "proof," such as the American flag appearing to wave in a vacuum, the absence of stars in the sky, and shadows that seem to point in different directions. All of these claims have been debunked by the scientific community with explanations tied to the physics of space and photography, but the theory has persisted for decades, fueled by a general distrust of government and media.

                            Popularized by conspiracy theorist David Icke, this theory asserts that a race of alien reptoids from the Alpha Draconis star system, known as the "Anunnaki," have been secretly interbreeding with humans for centuries. These reptilian shapeshifters, Icke claims, have infiltrated governments, royal families (most notably the British Royal family), and financial institutions to manipulate global events and establish a totalitarian control over humanity. The theory draws on ancient myths and is a prime example of a modern conspiracy that incorporates elements from science fiction and ufology.
